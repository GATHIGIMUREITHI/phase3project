## 🎯 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry, where acquiring new customers costs **5-25 times more** than retaining existing ones. This project builds a predictive model to:

- ✅ Identify customers at high risk of churning before they leave
- ✅ Understand key factors contributing to customer churn
- ✅ Develop targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rate
- ✅ Provide actionable insights for business stakeholders

**Stakeholder**: Executive Leadership Team at SyriaTel Telecommunications Company

## 💼 Business Problem

SyriaTel is experiencing customer attrition and needs a data-driven approach to:

1. **Predict** which customers are likely to churn
2. **Identify** the strongest predictors of churn behavior
3. **Segment** customers by risk level for targeted interventions
4. **Optimize** retention strategies to maximize ROI

### Success Criteria

- **Primary Metric**: Achieve **recall ≥ 70%** (catch most customers who will churn)
- **Rationale**: Missing a churning customer is more costly than false alarms
- **Business Impact**: Enable proactive retention campaigns with positive ROI

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. **Business & Data Understanding**
   - Defined business problem and success criteria
   - Explored dataset structure and features
   - Analyzed target variable distribution

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Investigated churn patterns across features
   - Identified key correlations with churn
   - Visualized customer segments and behaviors

### 3. **Data Preparation**
   - **Feature Engineering**:
     - Created aggregate usage features (total minutes, calls, charges)
     - Calculated usage ratios (international usage ratio)
     - Generated risk flags (high customer service calls)
     - Derived revenue metrics (revenue per day, avg call duration)
   - **Encoding**: Binary encoding for yes/no features, one-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler
   - **Train-Test Split**: 80/20 split with stratification

### 4. **Modeling**

Three classification models were trained and evaluated:

| Model | Description | Key Strength |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Baseline linear model | High interpretability |
| **Decision Tree** | Non-linear rule-based classifier | Captures complex patterns |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble of decision trees | Robust and accurate |

### 5. **Evaluation**

Models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision**: Accuracy of churn predictions
- **Recall**: Ability to catch churners (priority metric)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Discrimination capability

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Top Churn Predictors

1. **Customer Service Calls** 📞
   - Customers with **4+ calls** have significantly higher churn rates
   - Indicates unresolved issues or dissatisfaction

2. **International Plan** 🌍
   - Customers with international plans show distinct churn patterns
   - Suggests pricing or value perception issues

3. **Total Charges** 💰
   - High daily charges correlate with churn
   - Potential "bill shock" or competitor pricing advantages

4. **Voice Mail Plan** ✉️
   - Customers with voice mail plans have **lower churn rates**
   - Value-added services increase retention

5. **Usage Patterns** 📊
   - International usage ratio is a strong predictor
   - Extreme usage (very high or very low) indicates risk

### Customer Insights

- **High-Risk Segment**: International plan holders with high service calls
- **Low-Risk Segment**: Long-tenure customers with voice mail plans
- **Churn Trigger**: 4+ customer service calls is a critical threshold

## 📈 Model Performance

### Model Comparison

| Model | Test Accuracy | Test Precision | **Test Recall** | Test F1-Score | Test ROC-AUC |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression | 85.2% | 47.9% | **23.7%** | 31.7% | 84.1% |
| **Decision Tree** ⭐ | **96.9%** | **100.0%** | **78.4%** | **87.9%** | 87.3% |
| Random Forest | 95.1% | 97.1% | 68.0% | 80.0% | 90.8% |

### 🏆 Final Model Selection: **Decision Tree Classifier**

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Highest recall (78.4%) - catches most churners
- ✅ Perfect precision (100%) - no false positives
- ✅ High interpretability - easy to explain to stakeholders
- ✅ Strong overall performance (96.9% accuracy)

### Confusion Matrix (Decision Tree)

```
                Predicted
              Not Churn  Churn
Actual Not      570       0
       Churn     21      76
```

**Interpretation**:
- **True Negatives**: 570 (correctly identified loyal customers)
- **False Positives**: 0 (no false alarms)
- **False Negatives**: 21 (missed churners - 21.6% miss rate)
- **True Positives**: 76 (correctly caught churners - 78.4% catch rate)

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### 🚨 Immediate Actions (High-Risk Customers)

#### 1. Customer Service Quality Improvement
- **Finding**: Customers with 4+ service calls are at extreme risk
- **Action**: 
  - Implement first-call resolution training
  - Create dedicated retention team for high-volume callers
  - Root cause analysis for recurring issues
- **Expected Impact**: 30-40% reduction in high-call-volume churn

#### 2. International Plan Optimization
- **Finding**: International plan holders have higher churn rates
- **Action**:
  - Review pricing and value proposition
  - Offer bundled services or promotional rates
  - Proactive outreach with usage optimization tips
- **Expected Impact**: 20% reduction in international plan churn

### 📊 Medium-Term Strategies (At-Risk Segments)

#### 3. Usage-Based Interventions
- Monitor customers with high charges (bill shock prevention)
- Implement usage alerts and plan optimization recommendations
- Offer customized plans based on individual usage patterns

#### 4. Value-Added Services Promotion
- Promote voice mail plans to customers without them
- Bundle services to increase switching costs
- Create loyalty programs based on tenure

### 🎯 Predictive Retention Program

#### 5. Risk-Based Scoring System
- **High Risk** (>70% churn probability): Personal call + special offers
- **Medium Risk** (40-70%): Automated email campaigns + value reminders
- **Low Risk** (<40%): Standard satisfaction surveys

#### 6. Financial Analysis Example

With 1,000 predicted churners:
- **Model Recall**: 78.4% → Identify 784 actual churners
- **Retention Campaign Success**: 30% → Retain 235 customers
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: $1,200 per customer
- **Retention Cost**: $100 per offer

**ROI Calculation**:
```
Value Saved: 235 customers × $1,200 = $282,000
Campaign Cost: 1,000 offers × $100 = $100,000
Net Benefit: $182,000
ROI: 182%
```

### 🔄 Continuous Improvement

- Deploy model for monthly customer scoring
- A/B test retention strategies
- Monitor model performance and retrain quarterly
- Collect feedback from churned customers to improve model

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Analysis

1. Open the main notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/churn_prediction_analysis.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

3. Generated visualizations will be saved to the `images/` directory

### Using the Model for Predictions

```python
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# Load the trained model (if saved)
# with open('models/decision_tree_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
#     model = pickle.load(f)

# Load new customer data
new_customers = pd.read_csv('new_customer_data.csv')

# Preprocess (apply same transformations as training)
# ... feature engineering, encoding, scaling ...

# Make predictions
churn_predictions = model.predict(new_customers_processed)
churn_probabilities = model.predict_proba(new_customers_processed)[:, 1]

# Identify high-risk customers
high_risk = new_customers[churn_probabilities > 0.7]
print(f"High-risk customers: {len(high_risk)}")
```
